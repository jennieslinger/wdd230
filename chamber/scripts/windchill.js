Windchill = 35.74 + (0.6215*temperature)-(35.75*speed)

get the two input values of temperature and wind speed,


    check to make sure they meet the specification limits(<= 50Â°F and > 3.0mph) allowed to officially calculate the wind chill, and


either calculate and display the wind chill factor value or display "N/A"(not applicable) if the input values did not meet the requirements.

ðŸ’¡Wind Chill Help
It is recommended that you isolate the temperature and wind speed values in your HTML document for easy extraction.When you isolate a value, consider using the tag and do not include the unit labels in your spanned content.

The formula to calculate the wind chill factor is 
where Twc is the wind chill index in Fahrenheit, Ta is the air temperature in Fahrenheit, and v is the wind speed in miles per hour.

Wind Chill Specification Limits: "Wind Chill Temperature is officially defined for temperatures at or below 10 Â°C (50 Â°F) and wind speeds above 4.8 kilometers per hour (3.0 mph)." - U.S.National Weather ServiceLinks to an external site.

In the future, we will be getting live temperature and wind speed values from which we can plug into our wind chill function.
